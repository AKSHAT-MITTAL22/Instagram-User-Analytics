# Instagram-User-Analytics
This project helps to analyse the raw data/metadata to create useful insights. Various database management tools can be used to extract useful insights and even visualise them. This enables a way to increase efficiency of a platform.

We are required to provide a detailed report answering the questions below :

A) Marketing: The marketing team wants to launch some campaigns, and they need your help with the following:

  1. Rewarding Most Loyal Users: People who have been using the platform for the longest time.
     Task: Find the 5 oldest users of the Instagram from the database provided
``2. Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting: By sending them promotional emails to post their 1st photo.
     Task: Find the users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram
  3. Declaring Contest Winner: The team started a contest and the user who gets the most likes on a single photo will win the contest now they wish to declare the            winner.
     Task: Identify the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team
  4. Hashtag Researching: A partner brand wants to know, which hashtags to use in the post to reach the most people on the platform.
     Task: Identify and suggest the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform
  5. Launch AD Campaign: The team wants to know, which day would be the best day to launch ADs.
     Task: What day of the week do most users register on? Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign
     
B) Investor Metrics: Our investors want to know if Instagram is performing well and is not becoming redundant like Facebook, they want to assess the app on the following                      grounds:

   1. User Engagement: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts
      Task: Provide how many times does average user posts on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users
   2. Bots & Fake Accounts: The investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts
      Task: Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).
